# MIT 6.824: Distributed Systems

The 6.824 is a very interesting course of MIT on distributed systems. 
Alongside the lectures, you also have a chance to implement a basic distributed system using Go by going through 4 labs.
You are going to learn and implement MapReduce, Raft, Sharding and a lot of other stuff.

How to approach it:

1. Watch the lecture videos with the handouts from the course.
2. Read the papers 
3. Taking your own notes.
4. Implement the labs

## Notes on Lecture

## Notes on Lab

There are 4 labs in this course. 

They are supposed to be written in [Go language](https://golang.org).
Have a quick [introduction](https://tour.golang.org) here on the official website.

You can also refer to this [cheatsheet of Go](https://github.com/alfmunny/cheatsheets/blob/master/go-cheatsheet.md) for a quick recap of the basics.
